<h1>Election 2020</h1>
    <div style="width: 900px; text-align: left;">
        <p>
        Each circle below represents 200,000 votes received by Joe Biden (blue) or Donald Trump (red) in the
        2020 US presidential election. Each state is tinted red or blue based on the percentage of margin of victory in the state.
        States that are nearly tied appear as white. States that were overwhelmingly won by one candidate or the other will
        appear slightly blue (for Joe Biden) or red (for Donald Trump).  The data is pulled live from the <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/2020-national-popular-vote-tracker/">Cook Political Report's 2020 Popular Vote Tracker</a>.

    This map was developed by <a href="/gotz">David Gotz</a> at the <a href="/">UNC VACLab</a>. It is a 2020 update to
    the map discussed in <a href="http://gotz.web.unc.edu/2016/12/20/election-maps-representing-area-and-population/">this
    2016 blog post</a> about the misleading nature of some types of election maps.
